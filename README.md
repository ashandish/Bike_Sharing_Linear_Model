## General Information
Shared bikes can be borrowed by people on rental basis. Business problem is to find the variables on which demand of shared bikes depend.
Business Goal is to develop a a Linear Regression Model which can predict the demand of Shared bikes. 
We are using the dataset day.csv which has records of 2 years by date with count of bikes rented every day based on factors such as weather, temperature, windspeed , season etc. 
DataSet and Data dictionary is provided. 


## Technologies Used
Following Python Libraries are used during the code development: matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, statsmodels, numpy, pandas


## Conclusions
Demand of Shared Bikes is highly dependent on temperature and Wind Speed.

Demand of Shared Bikes is more in some months such as September.

Demand of Shared Bikes increases in  Winter Season.

Demand of Shared Bikes is less in Weather type 3( Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds).

With the years passing by, the demand of Sharing bikes is increasing as the demand of Shared bikes was more in 2019 than in 2018.
