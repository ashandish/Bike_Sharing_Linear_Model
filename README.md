## General Information
Shared bikes can be borrowed by people on rental basis . Business problem is to find the variables on which demand of shared bikes depend .
Business Goal is to develop a a Linear Regression Model which can predict the demand of Shared bikes. 
We are using the dataset day.csv which has records of 2 years by date with count of bikes rented every day based on factors such as weather, temperature, windspeed , season etc. 
DataSet and Data dictionary is provided.
